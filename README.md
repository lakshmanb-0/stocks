## Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command.
3. Clone the repository using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/lakshmanb-0/stocks.git
    ```

## Install Dependencies

1. Navigate into the cloned repository's directory using the `cd` command.
2. Once inside the directory, install the required dependencies by running:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Run the Next.js Application

After installing the dependencies, you can run the Next.js application locally.

1. In the terminal, while still in the repository's directory, run the following command:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command starts the Next.js development server.

2. Once the server has started, you should see output indicating that the server is running. By default, the application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the running Next.js application.
